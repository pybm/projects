    In the first project is about a childhood game called "Bambilici electronic" where you asked to choose a random number, then the person asked you, will return the number you choose and add one number (+1) to the original chosen along with the message "I chose higher than you...you lost" 
    The second project is generating random numbers for the lotto game named 6/49, so the program will generate random numbers in the range from 1 to 49. I also made a generating program for the less popular games like “Joker” and 5/40. 
    Third project is about converting inches to centimeters.
