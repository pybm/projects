# Projects:

#1    In the first project is about a childhood game called "Bambilici electronic" where you asked to choose a random number, then the person asked you, will return the number you choose and add one number (+1) to the original chosen along with the message "I chose higher than you...you lost" 

#2    The second project is generating random numbers for the lotto game named 6/49, so the program will generate random numbers in the range from 1 to 49. I also made a generating program for the less popular games like “Joker” and 5/40. 

#3    My third project is about two premade intervals, first is 5 mins then the second one is 1 min, both distinguished at the end of countdown by specific beep sound. 
I had this idea from early 90s when I was experimenting this training technique by doing 1 exercise for 5 min then rest for 1 min, back then the only efficient way was by timing with an electronic watch that required manual programming after each interval. 
These few lines of codes can be actually developed into a really useful phone app. Two example that can be use in are sport and cooking. 

#4   My fourth project is a simple task manger. 

#5   This project is a raw representation of galaxies in the universe. Using tree variable and the normal distribution with mean at 10 and standard deviation at 100, we have a 3d plot with 1000 galaxies for each axis. Simple project but impactful.
